# Preference Tuning Research Resources
This is the list of tutorials, workshops, papers, and resources on RL and preference tuning (with or without human feedback) research, which includes most (if not all) papers discussed in our survey paper: [Preference Tuning with Human Feedback on Language, Speech, and Vision Tasks: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11564).

The paper list will be updated over the time. You are always more than welcome to send a pull request for updating the list and be one of the contributors!
